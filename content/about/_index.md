We are a working group that promotes the adoption of **free technologies** to address issues related to **climate action** and sustainable **local development**. We prioritize strategies that provide sustained support over time and maximize impact. 

We work to support companies, organizations, institutions, groups, and individuals, integrating them throughout the entire process.

Our main objective is to promote the connection between free technologies for the production, analysis, and visualization of geospatial data and the needs of the groups we work with.
